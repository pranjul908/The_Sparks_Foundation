# The_Sparks_Foundation
Hello Folks, I've completed my Task - 6 i.e. Testing (Automated) from #GRIPAPRIL2023 as a Web Development Intern under GRADUATE ROTATIONAL INTERNSHIP PROGRAM (GRIP) by The Sparks Foundation. In this project I used Selenium to create a test case to test the website thesparksfoundation.sg.

My task is to,

◇ Read up about Testing.

◇ Learn selenium and basic selenium automation scripting.

◇ Start with Google Search and read tutorials. Watch videos to learn about various aspects of testing using selenium.

◇ Use selenium to create a test case to test the website thesparksfoundation.sg

◇ The test script should check of at least 5 pages and 10 elements in total.

◇ Each element could be e.g. if the Logo exists, the navigation bar appears, the name on about us page is correct, etc.
